# Vercel Web Analytics Implementation

## Summary
Successfully installed and configured Vercel Web Analytics for this Next.js App Router project.

## Changes Made

### 1. Installed Dependencies
- **@vercel/analytics** (v1.6.1): Main analytics package
- Also fixed missing dependencies that were causing build failures:
  - @radix-ui/react-collapsible (v1.1.12)
  - @radix-ui/react-use-controllable-state (v1.2.2)
  - cmdk (v1.1.1)
  - framer-motion (v12.34.3)
  - libphonenumber-js (v1.12.37)
  - nanoid (v5.1.6)
  - date-fns (v4.1.0)
  - @react-types/shared (v3.33.0) [dev dependency]

### 2. Modified Files

#### app/layout.tsx
- Added import: `import { Analytics } from '@vercel/analytics/next';`
- Added `<Analytics />` component inside the `<body>` tag, after the Toaster components
- The component is placed at the root layout level to track analytics across all pages

#### package.json
- Updated dependencies to include @vercel/analytics and other missing packages
- Package manager: Using pnpm (lockfile: pnpm-lock.yaml)

## Implementation Details

The Analytics component was added to the root layout file (app/layout.tsx) as this is a Next.js App Router project. The component is placed inside the `<body>` tag after the existing UI components (Toaster, SonnerToast), which is the recommended position according to Vercel's documentation.

## Verification

- ✅ Build completed successfully with `pnpm run build`
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ Analytics component properly integrated in the root layout
- ✅ Lock file (pnpm-lock.yaml) updated with new dependencies

## Notes

- The project had several missing dependencies that were preventing successful builds. These have been installed along with the analytics package.
- The Analytics component will automatically track page views and web vitals when deployed to Vercel.
- No additional configuration is required - the component works out of the box.
